FinanceQA is a comprehensive testing suite designed to evaluate LLMs' performance on complex financial analysis tasks that mirror real-world investment work. The dataset aims to be substantially more challenging and practical than existing financial benchmarks, focusing on tasks that require precise calculations and professional judgment.

**Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18062

**Description**  

The dataset contains two main categories of questions:
1. <ins>Tactical Questions</ins>: Questions based on financial documents that test calculation accuracy, accounting standards, assumption-making, and real-world practices.
   - Basic questions 
   - Assumption-based questions (requiring inference with incomplete information)

2. <ins>Conceptual Questions</ins>: Questions testing understanding of financial relationships, logical derivations, industry estimations, and accounting principles.

**Fields**

The dataset contains the following components:
* `context`: Relevant sections from primary financial documents (e.g., 10-K sections)
* `question`: The specific financial analysis task or query
* `answer`: The correct calculation or response
* `chain_of_thought`: The reasoning logic to arrive at the correct answer
* `question_type`: Categorization as either "basic", "assumption", or "conceptual"
* `company`: The company in question
* `file_link`: The link to the source of the context field
* `file_name`: The file name of the source of the context field
Output:
{
    "extracted_code": ""
}
